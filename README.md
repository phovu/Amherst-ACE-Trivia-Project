## What is Java Swing & Swing UI Designer
You may create your GUI program with the aid of the Swing UI Designer.With Swing UIDesigner, you can design your GUI Form by “drag and drop style”. With Swing UI Designer, youdo not need to do hard coding for all parts of your GUI program.With Swing UI Designer, some codes are automatically created as you add and set the properties of an element of your GUI.

## Problem Identification, Statement, & Solutions
* Amherst students may lack the knowledge about their school 
  * Statement: We want to build a special project that helps  students learn about the history of Amherst College through a set of questions aiming at training muscle memory.
    * Solution 1: 
    * Solution 2:
    * Solution 3:

## Prototyping
<img width="781" alt="prototyping" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67770858/168407722-a6d9be39-6c64-4705-a842-7f8951f64fd6.png">


## Project Description
We want to make a timed general knowledge game that tests students' knowledge about Amherst College history. The game has its title on the main screen with menu buttons. 

The menu includes buttons for game activation, game description (illustrated with “About”), user review (illustrated with “Rate Us”), credits (illustrated with “Credits”), and exit (illustrated with “Quit”).

The game screen will display the accumulated score of the player as he/she moves to the next round. The function for the score section adds up the score attained from each round.

As for the color background, we hope to employ a palette consisting of these colors below:

- ![#7c02ff](http://via.placeholder.com/20/7c02ff/7c02ff) `#7c02ff`
- ![#19ff00](http://via.placeholder.com/20/19ff00/19ff00) `#19ff00`
- ![1d1f21](http://via.placeholder.com/20/1d1f21/1d1f21) `#1d1f21`
- ![f8f8f8](http://via.placeholder.com/20/f8f8f8/f8f8f8) `#f8f8f8`

## About The Game
* There are 15-20 multiple-choice questions related to the history of establishment of Amherst College. A login page will appear for game players to enter their username before they can play the game.

* There are four choices for each question. Each choice is illustrated by A, B, C, and D. There is only one correct answer to each question. For each correct answer, the player scores 1 point. If the player gets the question wrong, the player won’t get his/her points deducted. The game has a timer which limits the game to 60 seconds. 

* In the end, if the player accumulates more than 75% of the total score, the player wins and vice versa. In the case of winning, an upbeat sound effect will play in the background with a happy face and a line that says “Congratulations, our Amherst Ace!” In the case of losing, a downbeat sound effect will play in the background. Alongside that, the screen will demonstrate a line that says “Good luck next time!” with a sad face.

### Credits
* This part entails information of the game developers and the year that the game is created.
We hope to attach a website that entails insights about the game.

* Expected Date: May 1st, 2022
* **Updated on May 14th, 2022**: Finished on May 13th, 2022

### Rate Us
This section asks for the player’s opinion regarding the game. The player can give ratings for the game on the scale from 1 to 5 stars. The player can also report personal opinions or errors that he or she finds within the game.

### Exit
If the player clicks on this button, it will take the player to the page with a line that says “Thank you for playing with us. See you soon, Ace!”
